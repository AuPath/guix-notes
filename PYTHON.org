* Creating a Python package definition

Fortunately the Guix pypi import function made it easy by generating
package definitions such as for the Python 'prov' package:

: guix import pypi prov

renders a cut-and-paste JSON style package definition

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(package
  (name "python-prov")
  (version "1.5.3")
  (source
    (origin
      (method url-fetch)
      (uri (pypi-uri "prov" version))
      (sha256
        (base32
          "1a9h406laclxalmdny37m0yyw7y17n359akclbahimdggq853jd0"))))
  (build-system python-build-system)
  (home-page "https://github.com/trungdong/prov")
  (synopsis
    "A library for W3C Provenance Data Model supporting PROV-JSON, PROV-XML and PROV-O (RDF)")
  (description

The difference with JSON is that this is executable Scheme code.  This
is all you need to add a Python package to GNU Guix. Note that it
fetches the latest version and even the software license!  Note also
how high-level the definition is. Not even a download URL to specify.
