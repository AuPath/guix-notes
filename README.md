# Hacking Guix

Want to get rid of Ruby RVM? These documents tell you how. The Guix
solution is simpler and at the same time more robust.

Pjotr's notes on working with GNU Guix. I have gathered 'bootstrapping'
Guix, hacking Guix packages with Guile and the philosophy of creating
a Ruby environment and getting rid of RVM and the like.

These text files are written with emacs org-mode. I'll create HTML
versions at some point.

Enjoy.
