# Hacking Guix

Want to get rid of Ruby RVM and/or have a controlled Python
environment?  These documents tell you how. The Guix solution is
simple and at the same time robust.

You may wanto to read [this
article](http://elephly.net/posts/2015-04-17-gnu-guix.html) about Guix
on compute clusters.

This repository contains Pjotr's notes on working with GNU Guix. I
have gathered [install and 'bootstrapping'
Guix](https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/INSTALL.org),
[hacking](https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/HACKING.org)
Guix packages with Guile and the philosophy of creating a
[Ruby](https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/RUBY.org)
environment and getting rid of RVM and the like.

These text files are written with emacs org-mode. 

Enjoy,

Pjotr Prins
