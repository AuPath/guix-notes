# Hacking Guix

Want to get rid of Ruby RVM and/or have a controlled Python
environment?  These documents tell you how. The Guix solution is
simple and at the same time robust.

The software graph is getting increasingly complex over time. GNU Guix
is the one solution that can handle that complexity. Rather than going
for ad hoc solutions, such as Docker and Brew, Pjotr champions using
the right tool for the job.

This repository contains Pjotr's notes on working with GNU Guix. I
have gathered [install and 'bootstrapping'
Guix](https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/INSTALL.org),
[hacking](https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/HACKING.org)
Guix packages with Guile and the philosophy of creating a
[Ruby](https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/RUBY.org)
environment and getting rid of RVM, bundler, virtualenv and the like.

You may want to also read [Ricardo's
article](http://elephly.net/posts/2015-04-17-gnu-guix.html) about Guix
on compute clusters and [Malcolm's
guide](https://github.com/malcook/sce/blob/master/README.org).

Enjoy!
