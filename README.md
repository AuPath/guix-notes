# Hacking Guix

Want to get rid of Ruby RVM and/or have a controlled Python
environment?  These documents tell you how. The Guix solution is
simple and at the same time robust.

This repository contains Pjotr's notes on working with GNU Guix. I
have gathered [install and 'bootstrapping'
Guix](https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/INSTALL.org),
[hacking](https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/HACKING.org)
Guix packages with Guile and the philosophy of creating a
[Ruby](https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/RUBY.org)
environment and getting rid of RVM and the like.

You may want to also read [Ricardo's
article](http://elephly.net/posts/2015-04-17-gnu-guix.html) about Guix
on compute clusters and [Malcolm's
guide](https://github.com/malcook/sce/blob/master/README.org).

Enjoy!
