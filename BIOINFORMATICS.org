#+TITLE: GNU Guix and Bioinformatics

* Introduction

Bioinformatics needs GNU Guix because:

1. Software gets installed and deployed often
2. There are many dependencies between software packages
3. Often multiple versions of software are run at the same time
4. Reproducible installs is a requirement in Science
5. Sane 1-click installs are the future

See the [[https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/README.md][README]] for more on installing and hacking GNU Guix.

* Non-free packages

GNU Guix only accepts packages that have an FSF approved license. For Bioinformatics we also
have non-free packages, but they live in separate repositories, e.g.

+ https://github.com/genenetwork/guix-nonfree
+ https://github.com/genenetwork/guix-bioinformatics-nonfree

Use the GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH to include one or more of these package lists.
