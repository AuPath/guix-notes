** A complex deployment

In the context of a web service we deploy a large stack of tools that
invoke other tools. The web servers require multiple versions of
Python (2.4, 2.7 and 3.x series) mostly because of incompatibilities
between Python modules and their bindings. We also have tools in there
that are written in R (some with Python RPy2 bridges), C, C++, D,
Elixir, Fortran - you name it.
