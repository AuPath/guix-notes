# GNU Guile devroom call for talks @FOSDEM 2016 

For the first time ever, we have a GNU Guile devroom at FOSDEM on January 30,
2016. The call for talk proposals is open! Important members of the GNU Guile
and GNU Guix community will attend. We are excited because FOSDEM is one of the
most important FOSS conferences and is hosted annually at [Universit√© libre de
Bruxelles in Brussels,
Belgium](https://fosdem.org/2016/practical/transportation/); the devroom will
host 80 people.

Submissions for talks are due on November 30, 2015. 

## Topics

GNU Guile is the preferred extension system for the GNU Project which
features an implementation of the Scheme programming language, a dialect of
Lisp. Especially technical talks are invited on topics concerning GNU Guile and
applications that use Guile (such as GNU Guix, Lilypond and Gnucash). In the
talks both experienced Guile programmers and newbies should be addressed.
FOSDEM is a great opportunity to attract people interested in GNU Guile and
Lisp. Examples of (already proposed) talks could be

- Guile programming:
  + functors and monads in Guile
  + composable continuations in Guile
  + posix programming in Guile and the FFI
- Web frameworks with GNU Guile
- GNU Guix:
  + GNU/Hurd support in Guix
  + R, Perl, Python and Ruby support in GNU Guix
  + Reproducible pipelines for Guix
  + Guix environments (VM, Docker)
- Guile and the network:
  + Software distribution using Gnunet
  + Paving a path to greater network freedom using Guix and Guile

## Submit talk

Feel free to submit your own topic or even run with one of these.  The
most interesting talks will be selected.  Talks are 15 or 30 minutes
(including Q&A; please notify in the application your preference) on
GNU Guile related projects.

Please note that presenting at FOSDEM implies giving permission to be
recorded. The recordings will be published under the same licence as
