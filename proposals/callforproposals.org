GNU Guile — the official extension language for the GNU Project

The FOSDEM Call for Proposals for the first ever GNU Guile devroom on
January 30, 2016 is open! Important members of the GNU Guile and GNU
Guix community will attend. FOSDEM is hosted at [Université libre de
Bruxelles in Brussels,
Belgium](https://fosdem.org/2016/practical/transportation/); the
devroom will host 80 people.

FOSDEM Submissions are due on December 1, 2015. If you submitted a
talk to a previous FOSDEM, you should already have an account in
Pentabarf, so make sure that you log in with your existing account.
You should only need to create an account if you have not submitted a
talk to FOSDEM in recent years. FOSDEM has multiple devrooms, so
please make sure that you select the "GNU Guile" devroom in the
"Track" dropdown when you submit your talk. Submissions filed under an
incorrect devroom will not be included!

Talks of 15 or 30 minutes (including Q&A; please notify in the
application your preference) on GNU Guile related projects. Also note
that


Topic Description:

GNU Guile is the preferred extension system for the GNU Project which
features an implementation of the Scheme programming language, a
dialect of Lisp. Technical talks are invited on technical topics on
GNU Guile and applications that use Guile (such as GNU Guix and
Lilypond and Gnucash). In the talks both experienced Guile
programmers, bringing them up to date, and newbies should be
addressed. FOSDEM is a great opportunity to attract people interested
in GNU Guile and LISP. Examples are

- An introduction to GNU Guile
- Guile Next: Latest developments in GNU Guile
- Guile programming:
  + functors and monads in Guile
  + composable continuations in Guile
  + posix programming in Guile and the FFI
- Web frameworks with GNU Guile
- GNU Guix:
  + Latest GNU Guix developments
  + GNU/Hurd support in Guix
  + Python and Ruby support in GNU Guix
  + Adding reproducible bioinformatics pipelines to Guix
- Guile and the network:
  + Software distribution using Gnunet
  + Paving a path to greater network freedom using Guix and Guile
- The Guile community we could have (Or: solving Worse is More
  Accessible)  

Please note that presenting at FOSDEM implies giving permission to be
