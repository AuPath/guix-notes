* GNU Guile devroom call for talks @FOSDEM 2017

We are excited to announce that we have a GNU Guile devroom at FOSDEM
on February 4th 2017. The call for talk proposals is open! We are
excited because FOSDEM is one of the most important free software
conferences and is hosted annually at [[https://fosdem.org/2017/practical/transportation/][Universit√© libre de Bruxelles in
Brussels, Belgium]]; the devroom will host up to 80 people. FOSDEM is
fantastic, check last year's schedule for [[https://archive.fosdem.org/2016/schedule/day/saturday/][Saturday]] and the GNU Guile
Devroom [[https://archive.fosdem.org/2016/schedule/track/gnu_guile/][track]].

Submissions for talks are due on November 18th, 2016.

** Topics

GNU Guile is the preferred extension system for the GNU Project which
features an implementation of the Scheme programming language, a
dialect of Lisp. Especially technical talks are invited on topics
concerning GNU Guile and applications that use Guile (such as GNU
Guix, Lilypond and Gnucash). In the talks both experienced Guile
programmers and newbies should be addressed.  FOSDEM is a great
opportunity to attract people interested in GNU Guile and
Lisp. Examples of (already) [[https://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:Guix/TalkProposals][proposed]] talks could be

1. A friendly introduction to GNU Guile and GNU Guix
2. Guile programming and optimisation
3. Network freedom live at the REPL
4. Adding GNU/Hurd support to GNU Guix and GuixSD
5. Game programming with GNU Guile
6. Web programming with GNU Guile
7. Shepherd the systemd replacement
8. Programming language support in GNU Guix
9. Virtual environments and targets such as CONDA in GNU Guix
10. Software distribution using Gnunet
11. Latest Guile developments
12. Latest GNU Guix developments
13. Getting started with guile-wiredtiger
