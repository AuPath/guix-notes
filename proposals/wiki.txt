= A list of proposed talks for a GNU Guile/Guix track @FOSDEM 2017 =

== A friendly introduction to GNU Guile and GNU Guix ==

by Ricardo Wurmus

== Guile programming and optimisations ==

by Andy Wingo

== Network freedom live at the REPL ==

by Christopher Allan Webber

Much has happened over the last year in terms of advancing network freedom both within and external to Guile.  We'll see a live demonstration of Pubstrate, a federated social networking toolkit as well as reference implementation for [ActivityPub https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/ ActivityPub] and [https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/ ActivityStreams], written in and for GNU Guile.

Asynchronous programming has also gotten much more interesting in the last year for Guile hackers, with improvements in Guile core and new libraries such as 8sync, A-Sync, and Fibers.  An overview of these systems will be given, as well as suggestions on how you can get hacking towards liberating network users today!

== Adding GNU/Hurd support to GNU Guix and GuixSD ==

by Manolis Ragkousis

GNU Guix can successfully cross-build any package for the Hurd and produce
the bootstrap-tarballs to build packages with Guix natively on such a system.
It can also build and deploy a GuixSD image from a Debian/Hurd system.

== Game programming with GNU Guile ==

by David Thompson

== Web programming with GNU Guile ==

== Shepherd the systemd replacement ==

== Programming language support in GNU Guix ==

by Pjotr Prins

== Software distribution using Gnunet ==

== Latest Guile developments ==

by Andy Wingo

== Latest GNU Guix developments ==

by Ludovic Courtès

== A friendly introduction to GNU Guile and GNU Guix ==

by Ricardo Wurmus

== Paving a path to greater network freedom ==

by Christopher Allan Webber

How can Guix and Guile participate in increasing network freedom?  Discussions include leveraging Guix to make server deployment and maintainance a better experience, as well as ideas in how Guile could provide leadership in web development and federation.

== The Guile community we could have (Or: solving Worse is More Accessible) ==

by Christopher Allan Webber

Expanding on [https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-devel/2015-09/msg00049.html this email], an exploration of how we could grow Guile into a more diverse community while leveraging its existing strengths.  Examinations will be made of what has and hasn't worked for similar language and programming communities.

== Latest Guile developments ==

by Andy Wingo

== Latest GNU Guix developments ==

by Ludovic Courtès


GNU Guix is the package manager for the GNU project. It is based on Guile and in this talk I am going to
present gexps and related APIs

== Adding GNU/Hurd support to GNU Guix and GuixSD ==

GNU Guix can successfully cross-build any package for the Hurd and produce

It can also build and deploy a GuixSD image from a Debian/Hurd system.

== Adding Python and Ruby support to GNU Guix ==

by Dave Thompson & Pjotr Prins

We added support for Python and Ruby packages to GNU Guix. We
think the process of adding them is interesting for others who would
like to support their language and or software stack.

== GNUNet publishing of Guix using Guile ==

by Remy

As a GSoC project GNUNet support was added.

== Adding reproducible bioinformatics pipeline support to GNU Guix ==

by Ricardo Wurmus & Pjotr Prins

Bioinformatics requires rapid turn around times in software packaging. This leads to many ad hoc installations
which lead to hard to maintain systems and little chance of reproducibility. In this talk we will discuss
software dependency graphs and explain why GNU Guix lends itself to deploying reproducible bioninformatics pipelines.
