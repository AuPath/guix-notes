* Minimalistic, Experimental and Emerging Languages Devroom
  call for talks @FOSDEM 2020

(posted at https://libreplanet.org/wiki/FOSDEM2020-devroom-minimalism)

We are excited to announce a devroom on minimalistic, experimental
and/or emerging languages (with big ideas) at FOSDEM on Sunday
February 2nd 2020!

FOSDEM is one of the most important free software conferences and is
hosted annually at Université libre de Bruxelles in Brussels,
Belgium. FOSDEM is fantastic, check last year's schedule for Saturday
(https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/day/saturday/)

We accept talks from languages that have interesting ideas or
prospects, but are not considered main stream (yet). If you are
working on an experimental or emerging language feel free to
submit a talk proposal.

Minimalism is also a topic for this devroom. Minimalism
matters. Minimalism allows for smaller systems that take less
resources and consume less energy. More importantly, free and open
source minimalism allows for secure systems that are easy to
understand. Finally, we believe that minimalism is educational and
brings back the fun of the early days of computing where people learn
to understand systems from the ground up. Speakers will be asked to
accentuate the educational side of their projects.

We have a room Sunday 2 February 2020. We want to invite you to submit
a talk on the use of minimalistic, experimental and/or emerging
languages that fits that description. We are especially happy to
receive talk submissions from members of any underrepresented groups.

If you have something you’d like to share with your fellow developers,
please E-mail us! Talks considered for the devroom will have to
be entered in
