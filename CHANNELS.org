* Guix Channels

Guix channels allow for out-of-tree (that is the Guix repo) packages,
including distribution of non-free software (which we recommend
against installing, but then reality sometimes is not nice). Note that
this page is not related to the GNU project (see below).

Check out:

- [[https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix][NonGuix]] is a software repository for the GNU Guix package
  manager, which packages some software which cannot be included in
  the official distribution for ethical or policy-related reasons.

For Bioinformatics and HPC

  Medical Systems Biology, The Berlin Institute for Medical Systems
  Biology (BIMSB)
- https://github.com/UMCUGenetics/guix-additions Guix packages used at
  Univeristy Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU)

  Guix packages used by University of Tennessee Health Science Center
  (UTHSC) and GeneNetwork.org
- https://github.com/ekg/guix-genomics Guix packages for the variation
  graph (VG and vgtools)

These packages can be installed using GNU Guix by adding Guix
[[Ghttps://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Channels.html][channels]].

If you use non-free software *PLEASE do NOT promote* these
repositories on any official GNU Guix communication channels, such as
their mailing lists or IRC channel, even in response to support
requests! This is to show respect for the Guix projectâ€™s strict policy
against recommending nonfree software, and to avoid any unnecessary
hostility.

Before using these channel, you should understand the implications of
using nonfree software. Read [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html][What is free software?]] for more
information. Do note that we also have free software on these channels
which may not have gone upstream for other reasons.
