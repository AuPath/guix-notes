# TITLE: GNU Guix and Bioinformatics

# Introduction

Bioinformatics needs GNU Guix because:

1. Software gets installed and deployed often
2. There are many dependencies between software packages
3. Often multiple versions of software are run at the same time
4. Reproducible installs is a requirement in Science
5. Sane 1-click installs are the future
